* Welcome!

  This package contains a Haskell module for computing approximate sunrise and
  sunset UTC times from latitude and longitude.

  Note that approximations are provided in UTC time only, no additional support
  for time zones is implemented.

  This module has only been lightly tested, and produces values close to those
  found at http://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/RS_OneYear.php.
